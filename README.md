Dataset Import:

Download the dataset named "Ecommerce Customers_Kaggle" from Kaggle.com.
Import the dataset into Google Colab using the pandas library.
Design ANN for Multiple Regression:

Design an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for multiple regression using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Use the four most relevant features from the dataset to predict the output.
Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluate your model's performance using the following metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R2)
Performance Grading:

Your grading on this assignment depends on the performance of your model. Achieving accurate predictions and minimizing errors will contribute to a higher grade.
Code Structure:

Write a single Python script that contains both PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations.
Ensure the script is well-organized, with proper comments and explanations.
Submission Requirements:

Submit only the Python script or file of your code.
Follow a specific naming format for your submitted file.
File Naming Convention:

The name of your submitted file should be in a specific format, which is not specified in your request. You might need to clarify the expected naming convention.
General Considerations:

Consider handling data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation in a structured manner.
Pay attention to hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Make sure your code is well-documented, making it easy for others to understand and reproduce your work.
